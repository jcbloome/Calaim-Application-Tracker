# Project Log Automation System

Ensures seamless continuity between AI sessions through automated progress tracking.

## 1. The Core Rule
**AFTER EVERY COMPLETED TASK**: Add one-line bullet point to PROJECT_LOG.md

### Trigger Phrases:
- "Add to PROJECT_LOG.md: [description]"
- "Log this completion: [description]"
- "Update project log: [description]"

## 2. What to Log

### ✅ Always Log These:
- New features completed
- Major bugs fixed
- Architectural decisions made
- Integration milestones reached
- Performance improvements
- Security enhancements
- Database schema changes
- API endpoint additions
- UI/UX improvements
- Deployment successes

### ❌ Don't Log These:
- Minor code formatting
- Documentation typos
- Dependency updates (unless breaking)
- Routine maintenance
- Work-in-progress items
- Failed attempts (unless learning)

## 3. Log Entry Format

### Standard Format:
```markdown
- ✅ **[Category]**: [Brief description] ([Date if not today])
```

### Examples:
```markdown
- ✅ **Feature Added**: Bulk operations for Kaiser member status updates
- ✅ **Bug Fixed**: Resolved infinite redirect loop in admin authentication
- ✅ **Integration**: Connected Google Drive API for document migration
- ✅ **Performance**: Optimized Firestore queries, reduced load time by 60%
- ✅ **Security**: Implemented role-based access control for admin functions
```

### Categories:
- **Feature Added** - New functionality
- **Bug Fixed** - Problem resolution
- **Integration** - External service connections
- **Performance** - Speed/efficiency improvements
- **Security** - Authentication/authorization changes
- **Architecture** - Structural decisions
- **Database** - Schema or data changes
- **API** - Backend endpoint changes
- **UI/UX** - Interface improvements
- **Deployment** - Production releases

## 4. Session Continuity Protocol

### For New AI Sessions:
1. **First Message**: "Read the PROJECT_LOG.md to see what I've been working on"
2. **AI Response**: Should acknowledge current state and recent progress
3. **Continue Development**: AI has full context of recent work

### For Ongoing Sessions:
1. **Complete Task**: Finish development work
2. **Log Entry**: Add bullet point to PROJECT_LOG.md
3. **Continue**: Move to next task with logged progress

## 5. Log Maintenance

### Weekly Review:
- Archive completed items older than 30 days
- Update "Current System Status" section
- Refresh "Next Development Phase" priorities

### Monthly Archive:
- Move old entries to "Archive" section
- Update architecture decision summaries
- Refresh known working patterns list

## 6. Integration with Rule Audit System

### Feature Counter Integration:
- When logging new features, increment feature counter
- Track progress toward next rule audit (8 features)
- Link feature completions to architectural pattern reviews

### Cross-Reference:
- PROJECT_LOG.md tracks WHAT was done
- Rule files track HOW it should be done
- Feature counter tracks WHEN to review patterns

## 7. Benefits for Development

### For You:
- Never lose track of progress
- Easy handoffs between AI sessions
- Clear development history
- Decision rationale preserved

### For AI Assistants:
- Instant context on project state
- Understanding of recent decisions
- Awareness of what's working/not working
- Continuity of development approach

## 8. Emergency Context Recovery

If PROJECT_LOG.md is lost or corrupted:
1. Check git history for recent commits
2. Review .cursor/rules/ for architectural decisions
3. Scan recent code changes for patterns
4. Rebuild log from commit messages and file changes
