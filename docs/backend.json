    "reasoning": "This Firestore structure prioritizes security and scalability for the Git State Restorer application, focusing on user authentication issues. It uses path-based ownership for user data and aims to support simple, robust security rules. Authorization Independence is achieved by avoiding `get()` calls in rules, relying solely on `request.auth.uid` and existence checks. The data structure also segregates user data, ensuring a homogeneous security posture within each collection. Specifically: The user document stores data for login, authentication, and rate limiting. Storing authentication-related details directly in the database could be beneficial for auditing or support. The design assumes all user-related data is private and accessible only to the user themselves. The path `/users/{userId}` provides a secure, path-based ownership model. The absence of collaborative features simplifies the authorization model, as access is primarily based on user identity."
